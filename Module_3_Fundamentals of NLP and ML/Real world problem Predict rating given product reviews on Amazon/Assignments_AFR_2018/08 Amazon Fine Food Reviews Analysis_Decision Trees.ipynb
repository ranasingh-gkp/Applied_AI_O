A rating of 4 or 5 can be cosnidered as a positive review. A rating of 1 or 2 can be considered as negative one. A review of rating 3 is considered nuetral and such reviews are ignored from our analysis. This is an approximate and proxy way of determining the polarity (positivity/negativity) of a review.\n","\n","\n"]},{"metadata":{"id":"syeYHDR_iWM7","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# [1].
